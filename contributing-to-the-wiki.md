You can contribute by:
* Adding a new [work, collection, person or organisation](/form-entry/) (or use the [quick form](/form-quick-entry/), which is easier and requires fewer details)
* Adding a new work or collection to the [Works not on the wiki](/works-not-on-the-wiki/) page for someone else to pick up on and add.
* Adding more details to an existing record

Editing a wiki can be a daunting task. If you're keen to help but aren't sure where to begin, email [the admin](mailto:sanglorian+mentor@gmail.com) to be assigned a mentor who can help you out.
