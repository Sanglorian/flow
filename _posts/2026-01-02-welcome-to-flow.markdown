Welcome to Free, Libre and Open Works!

FLOW is a database of free, libre and open-licensed works, as well as works under other "copyright minimal" licenses that do not qualify as free, libre and open. 

It is based on the Free & Open Works wiki (FAOW), which ran into hosting troubles soon after its launch in 2015.
