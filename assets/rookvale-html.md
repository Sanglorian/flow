<h1>Rookvale</h1>
<p>The Demons are Evolving</p>

<h1>Welcome to Rookvale</h1>
<p>Demons have beset the realm of Rookvale. Rumours are spreading through the alleyways of each city-province: maybe fault lies with Duchess Vare and her sorcerous investigations, or with the unorthodox liaisons of the northern provinces. Maybe this incursion was planned and bated by patriarchs in neighboring lands. While the origin is unclear, the situation is crystalline: demons roam Rookvale and have started evolving.</p>
<p>You’re one of the bands of misfits, heroes, and dark-art apprentices tasked with fighting back this incursion. But the reigning Demon Lords are nigh invulnerable to mortal weapons. The only way one has a chance at defeating a Demon Lord is to wield the power of a Demon Lieutenant. And in turn, defeating a Demon Lieutenant would require the aid of a Greater Demon. And so begins the circle of weakening, binding, summoning, and controlling. To defeat demons, one must control demons.</p>
<h1>Think “Grimdark Pokemon.”</h1>
<p>Rookvale is a setting for and remix of Anima Prime, by Christian Griffin, which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0, and is available at animaprimerpg.com. This document contains all the rules required to play Rookvale, though Anima Prime contains a more thorough introduction to roleplaying.</p>
<h1>An Overview</h1>
<p>One of the players takes on the role of <em>Game Moderator,</em> or GM. The GM controls all the adversity in the game, both demonic and mortal. They introduce new locations, play the minor characters, and control how the campaign world changes over time.</p>
<p>The rest of the players are each responsible for creating and playing a <em>Protagonist Character,</em> or PC. They have a personality, goals, a job within Rookvale, and powers to help them win fights and overcome challenges.</p>
<p>The game alternates between personal scenes, setup scenes, and cinematic battles. Most of the rules govern those battle sequences - full of dice and danger.</p>
<p>To play you’ll need all the print-outs for the game as well as some demons. Both are seperate PDF files. You’ll also need a seriously-large quantity of six-sided dice - 20 per player is advised. Finally, you’ll need some Awesome Tokens.</p>
<h1>Setting the Tone</h1>
<p>The Anima Prime engine leans heavily upon aesthetics, style, and flare. To really bring Rookvale to life, the group needs to be on the same page about these elements.</p>
<p>Rookvale is a world of chiseled stone, ancient matriachal lines, crooked daggers, crow-masked wanderers, sprawling castle keeps, and oaths sealed with a ceremonial spilling of blood.</p>
<p>The feel of a Rookvale session should be dark and apocalyptic, with space left for epic heroes to emerge from amidst the rubble and ash.</p>
<p>In striving for a “dark” or “gritty” game, it’s important to pay attention to the point after which the game would slip into melodrama and camp. Approach that line but do not cross it! Everyone has a different threshold for what will cause their eyes to roll, and part of playing Rookvale is finding that sweet spot of grim-drenched, grit-drenched darkness without any of the eye-rolling disbelief.</p>
<p>Each group that plays Rookvale will need to make their own aesthetic choices from here. Will there be plentiful gore or thin trickles of blood? Do demons move with unnatural joint articulation and click-click-clicking sounds, or is it more groaning and primordial? Does the evil lie solely in the hearts of demons, or is it woven throughout the fabric of Rookvale itself?</p>
<h1>Gender and Name</h1>
<p>When you play Rookvale, the PCs are a ragtag group of misfits, heroes, and dark-art apprentices tasked with defeating, binding, and controlling demons. They’ll together move through Rookvale, beating back the demon scourge, or die trying.</p>
<p>Rookvale is a realm ruled by its ladies and duchesses, but only with the assent of all involved. While gender roles are quite fluid within Rookvale, and their expression is constantly changing and being renegotiated, it is considered to be a taboo topic for discussing in mixed company.</p>
<p>To start the character creation process, the GM will hand out character sheets, and put the Gender cards on the table. Each player chooses one of Rookvale’s six genders for their character, and takes a copy of the appropriate card.</p>
<p>You’ll notice there is a place to list your Name. There’s a card called Names of Rookvale if you’d like help coming up with yours. Record a name for your character and let everyone know what it is.</p>
<h1>Powers and Traits</h1>
<p>Next, the GM will put out the Trade cards. Each player chooses one of the nine Trades for their character. This is what the character did before the demons arrived.</p>
<p>Your Trade grants your character three powers. Powers marked with an arrow (➹) are options to be used during battle scenes. Powers marked with a star (H) modify your character’s starting stats, and you should update your character sheet to reflect these improvements.</p>
<p>Each PC has three Traits. Traits are phrases that players write to describe their character’s strengths, quirks, and unique personality. They come up in both personal scenes and battle scenes. Each player now creates their first Trait, reflecting their background (whether it’s specific to their trade or something else).</p>
<p>Next, the GM will put out the Ordeal cards. Each player chooses one. They work just like Trade cards, but reflect a trying ordeal that the character experienced at some point - an ordeal that continues to shape who they are today.</p>
<p>Each player now creates their second Trait, reflecting how they’ve changed and grown since their ordeal.</p>
<p>Next, the GM will put out the Artifact cards. When the PCs were summoned before the Grand Duchess and enlisted in the campaign against demon incursion, they were each granted a talisman of great power to aid them in their quest. Each player chooses one of the six Artifacts as their own.</p>
<p>Going around in a circle, have each player describe their character to the group - how they dress, what their mannerisms are, what their strengths are, and how they take the news of their enlistment.</p>
<p>Each player now creates their final Trait, reflecting how they relate to others in the group of varied and strange adventurers that they’ve been saddled with.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of flexibility in what your Traits might look like. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destined to die in battle.</li>
<li>&quot;Walk quietly in the shadows of angels.”</li>
<li>Blood-bound to Methika’s side.</li>
<li>Amateur astrologer.</li>
<li>Ashamed of demonic heritage.</li>
<li>Raised by wolves.</li>
<li>Speaks the secret tongue of crows.</li>
<li>Of royal blood and association.</li>
<li>Always carries a hidden knife.</li>
<li>Unlikely to be fooled again.</li>
<li>Eager to please those around them.</li>
<li>“Does this look like the face of a liar?”</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stats and Skills</h1>
<p>Alright! Everyone has their Name, Gender, Trade, Ordeal, Artifact, and Traits.</p>
<p>Your powers will likely modify your starting stats. Your Defense score starts at 2. You start with four Wounds. You start with an Action Pool limit of 10, no limit on your Strike Pool, and a Charge Pool limit of 6. Add your modifications to these scores now. You begin play with a full Action Pool, and no dice in Strike or Charge.</p>
<p>To finish your character, choose three Skills from the list below. Give them these respective ranks: 4, 3, and 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brawling</li>
<li>Cunning</li>
<li>Grit</li>
<li>Haste</li>
<li>Hymns</li>
<li>Insight</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Might</li>
<li>Stealth</li>
<li>Taunting</li>
<li>Traps</li>
<li>Triage</li>
<li>Weapons</li>
<li>Witchcraft</li>
</ul>
<h1>Jesse, an Example PC</h1>
<p>Tinder / Hunter / Dark Visions / has the Crystal Heart</p>
<p>Defense: 3 <em>(2+1)</em>	Wounds: 4

Action Pool: 12 <em>(10+2)</em>	Charge Pool: 6</p>
<p>Skills: Insight 4, Haste 3, Brawling 2</p>
<p>Traits: Forest-dweller; Nothing can rattle me anymore; Falling in love with Tampa</p>
<h1>Character Scenes</h1>
<p>Character scenes help us explore the personalities, troubles, passions, and unfolding lives of our PCs. Between battles, there are a series of character scenes that track how the PCs are recovering, preparing, living, and changing.</p>
<p>Not all of the events have to happen in scenes or conflicts; you can have exchanges among the players and with the GM that talk about things that happen ”offscreen”. They take care of the times when the characters go somewhere and nothing special happens.</p>
<p>Some character scenes are solo, and others feature additional members of the group. Some will be introspective, others conversational, others active. You can utilize montage or flashback if desired.</p>
<p>Between battles, each PC can trigger one of the following benefits from a character scene:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heal 1 Wound on your PC.</li>
<li>Heal the Wounds on a demon.</li>
<li>Replenish your PC’s Action Pool to its maximum.</li>
<li>Mark 1 of your own PC’s Traits with a check.</li>
<li>Give a PC a Charge Die to start the next battle with.</li>
<li>Change your PC’s Gender (and its respective card).</li>
</ul>
<p>While there can be any number of character scenes between two battles, each PC can only trigger one benefit in total.</p>
<h1>Setup Scenes</h1>
<p>Once the character scenes have all concluded, a setup scene takes place. Setup scenes lead the characters to their next battle. They’re often quite short, and akin to “cut-scenes” in video games.</p>
<p>The GM has a map of Rookvale that they’ll be updating with demon threats and ongoing crises. The players will often be given a choice of where their next battle will take place. Other times, the GM will choose to spring a surprise encounter on the players - “While on your way to Southgate, you encounter a Ghast Lord attacking a caravan of travellers! How do you approach?”</p>
<p>The players collectively narrate how everyone positions themselves at the start of the battle. Based on their narration, the group will receive one of the following benefits heading into the battle:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>By scouting ahead,</em> the PCs discover a new course of action. The GM puts a new Goal on the table and assigns it a difficulty rating.</li>
<li><em>By studying the enemy,</em> the PCs uncover a secret edge. They each start with 1 free Charge Die.</li>
<li><em>By charging forward headlessly,</em> the PCs gain the advantage of surprise and momentum. The first Strike made during this battle gains +2 bonus dice.</li>
<li><em>By readying their tools,</em> the PCs ensure that they will be prepared for whatever happens. They each start with a Skill checked.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Battle Begins</h1>
<p>Each battle takes place between the PCs and one or more foes controlled by the GM. For the first battle, it’s advised that the GM choose a single Lesser Demon for the PCs to tackle.</p>
<p>In each battle, the PCs have a choice about their approach and tactics. They can choose to fight their opponents to the bitter death, or weaken them and seek an alternate victory - in the case of demons, binding and mastering them; in the case of mortal foes, negotiating a surrender or winning their fealty.</p>
<p>In addition to defeating enemies, battles will often have additional Goals. Goals are introduced by the GM and assigned a difficulty rating. They might include saving innocent villagers, reversing the environmental damage introduced by a demon, or being the first to make it to the Gates of Sulfur &amp; Shadow.</p>
<p>PCs all have four Wounds. Their foes will range from 1 to 6 Wounds on average. When a character runs out of Wounds, they are either dead or dying.</p>
<p>The Setup Scene leads directly into the Battle Scene. The GM will determine whether the PCs or their foes go first, following logically from the fiction. When it’s the PCs’ turn to act, the players can figure out amongst themselves who goes first. They can change this order each round. The foes all go together, in whatever order the GM decides upon each round.</p>
<h1>Turns</h1>
<p>During a PC or foe turn, that character gets one action. It will typically be one of the following five options:</p>
<p><strong>Maneuvers</strong> are used to gain Strike dice and Charge dice. Maneuvers can include strategic positioning, taunts, setup moves, initial flurries of blows, or any number of other things. Maneuvers prepare you for other types of actions, like Strikes and Achievements.</p>
<p><strong>Strikes</strong> are used to inflict damage on the opponent. They use up Strike dice. Once you’ve inflicted enough Wounds on your opponent to mark all their Wound circles, you knock them out of the conflict. You also might have Charge powers that you can add to a Strike if you can pay the required number of Charge dice.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements</strong> are used to accomplish goals. They use up Strike dice. Demons always come with the goal of binding &amp; mastering them, but the GM will often introduce additional Goals to reflect the scenario. You can also do <strong>Linked Achievements</strong> with another PC.</p>
<p><strong>Catching Your Breath</strong> restores some of your Action dice, readying you for more Maneuvers as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Powers</strong> that are listed as the Action type require the use of your action to take effect. Some additionally require the expenditure of Charge dice to use - if you don’t have enough Charge dice, you can’t use the power just yet.</p>
<h1>Maneuvers</h1>
<p>To do a Maneuver, first choose one of your character’s Skills to use for the Maneuver and describe it. You can get as grandiose and epic as you like. Maybe you run along rooftops, cast ash and bone while chanting the ancestral rites, drop silently from shadowy ledges, commune with angels, take shelter behind a towering salt pillar, taunt your opponent, rally troops, lay a trap, or something else. Next, it’s time to gather your dice.</p>
<p>Pick one of your Skills, and take dice equal to its rating (between 2-4). Don’t take these from your Action Pool - instead, I suggest having a big bowl of dice in the middle of the table from which you can draw more dice.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to use your highest Skill each time, and that’s fine. But there’s a perk to using them all. When you use a Skill, put a mark next to it. When each Skill has at least one mark, erase all the marks and gain two bonus dice, divided as you choose between Strike and Charge.</p>
<p>Next, add a number of dice from your Action Pool based on how much effort your character is putting into the Maneuver, ranging from 1 to 3 dice. You have to add at least 1 die. This uses up the dice from your Action Pool. If your Action Pool is empty, you can’t do Maneuvers.</p>
<p>Other players can also give you a gift die each from their own Action Pools, if they think your Maneuver was particularly impressive or if they want to support you. They do not have to have their characters actually assist. Granting another player a die does not use up the giving player’s action for the turn.</p>
<p>Roll all of those dice for a chance to gain successes. Every 3, 4, and 5 earns you a die for your Strike Pool. Every 6 earns you a die for your Charge Pool. 1s and 2s fail to gain you anything and are discarded.</p>
<p>After rolling, if you have a Trait marked from a character scene, you can erase the mark in exchange for rerolling your failed dice (1s and 2s). Describe how the trait figures into your current Maneuver. Reroll the failed dice and score successes as you would normally.</p>
<p>If you earn no dice at all (that is, you roll all 1s and 2s), your action dice are returned to your Action Pool, gifted dice from other PC players go back to their Action Pools, and any bonus dice are discarded.</p>
<p>Unless you have a power that says otherwise, you cannot earn more than 5 dice in a Maneuver. If you rolled more than 5 successes, pick which 5 you want to earn (in other words, prioritize between Strike dice and Charge dice, if applicable) and discard the rest.</p>
<p>If you ever want to take an action that just doesn’t fit any of your Skills, you can use 2 Skill dice, but you won’t get to mark any of your Skills. Deciding whether the action fits a Skill or not is up to the acting player.</p>
<h1>Awesome Tokens</h1>
<p>If you manage to earn 5 or more dice (Strike and Charge dice combined, not counting bonus dice from marking your Skills) at once, you earn an Awesome Token. The GM also earns these when a foe gains 5 or more dice in a Maneuver.</p>
<p>You can spend your Awesome Tokens during a conflict in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can take a free action that isn’t a Maneuver, even if you’ve already acted this round.</li>
<li>For 2 Awesome Tokens, you can take Wounds on behalf of another character. Since this happens after damage has been determined, it doesn’t matter if your defense is different than theirs - if they would have taken 2 Wounds, you instead take 2 Wounds.</li>
<li>For 3 Awesome Tokens, you can have your Strike count against 2 opponents at once. Designate both targets and roll your dice once (with the option of using your traits to improve your roll), then apply the successes against both. If some of your dice only work against certain types of adversity and you’re using the tokens to Strike against different types, make a separate roll for the type-specific dice.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use your Awesome Tokens on behalf of another player to grant them one of the benefits above. You can even pool Awesome Tokens for the more expensive benefits, even if the player who benefits does not contribute any Awesome Tokens herself.</p>
<h1>Strikes</h1>
<p>When you’re striking, take up to 6 dice from your Strike Pool. If you’re using any Charge powers, declare them now and pay their cost in Charge dice. Then roll the Strike dice plus any bonus dice from powers before you describe what you’re doing, so that you can fit your narration to the impact of the roll.</p>
<p>Unless you have a relevant power, you cannot roll more than 6 dice from your Strike Pool in a Strike. Bonus dice from powers are not limited in this fashion. You have to use at least 1 Strike die to make a Strike.</p>
<p>As with Maneuvers, every 3 or higher is a success. You compare the number of successes to the opponent’s Defense. If your number of successes does not equal or exceed the Defense, the attack fails and the Strike dice go back to the Strike Pool. Bonus dice and spent Charge dice are always used up.</p>
<p>If your number of successes equals or exceeds the target’s Defense, you inflict a Wound. For example, if their Defense is 3, you need to roll at least 3 successes to inflict a Wound. The Strike and bonus dice you rolled are discarded, and the opponent marks a Wound circle. The player of the victim either describes the Wound or lets the striking player do it.</p>
<p>You can inflict more than 1 Wound at a time, but that requires successes in multiples of the opponent’s Defense.</p>
<p>You can unmark a Trait to reroll your failed dice for a Strike. If you still fail, all Strike dice return to the Strike Pool as before, but the Trait remains unmarked.</p>
<p>You also can unmark a Trait to grant this boon to one of your allies. When you use up a Trait mark, you should narrate how that plays out.</p>
<h1>Achievements</h1>
<p>Every conflict has Goals, in addition to presenting you with an opportunity to kill all foes standing before you.</p>
<p>You can use an action to try to achieve one of the conflict Goals. Some are purely story-related, while others have specific mechanical effects.</p>
<p>Take up to 6 of your Strike dice, add dice from a Skill (and mark the Skill), and roll them all. Every 3 or higher is a success. You need to get as many successes as the difficulty rating of the Goal you’re trying to achieve. If you’re unsuccessful, all of the Strike dice return to your Strike Pool (bonus and Charge dice are always used up). However, if you are successful, all of the dice that you rolled are used up.</p>
<p>If the Skill you marked with the Achievement completed your set of three marked Skills, you erase the marks and gain the 2 bonus dice of your choice as usual, at the completion of this action (independent of whether you were successful or not).</p>
<h1>Linked Achievements</h1>
<p>Sometimes a Goal is too big to tackle alone. Linked Achievements let two PCs combine their abilities and dice, each dedicating their turn to a shared pursuit.</p>
<p>The first player must declare that they are initiating a Linked Achievement at the start of their turn. They choose a Goal that they will support someone in pursuing, gather their dice, and roll for an Achievement as normal. But they only count 5s and 6s as successes. These successes are set aside for the moment. Strike dice that came up 3 or 4 can be returned to the Strike Pool, while those that came up 1 or 2 are used up and discarded (along with the bonus and Charge dice).</p>
<p>The second player involved in the Linked Achievement can opt to back out, and use their turn for a different action. If they do, the dice that were set aside are now lost. Alternately, if the second player involved opts to follow through with the Linked Achievement, they follow the normal Achievement rules, and add all the dice that were set aside by the previous player as bonus dice to their roll.</p>
<p>Linked Achievements can thus allow the second in-volved player to roll more dice in pursuit of a Goal than would normally be possible.</p>
<h1>Catch Your Breath</h1>
<p>Once their Action Pool runs empty, a PC is seriously vulnerable and cannot do any more Maneuvers. If the character takes another action (Strike, Achievement, power) while not having any Action dice left, they take a Wound due to exhaustion. They can, however, Catch Their Breath for 1 round to regain 2 Action dice.</p>
<p>Catching Your Breath means the character cannot take an action for that round (unless you spend an Awesome Token). It’s okay to Catch Your Breath even if your Action Pool is not empty to gain back 2 action dice, up to your Action Pool’s maximum (10 by default).</p>
<p>The Action dice are earned at the end of the character’s turn. This might matter when conditions or powers take away some of the character’s Action dice.</p>
<p>While your character is Catching Their Breath, they’re not Maneuvering or otherwise attacking the enemy. Your narration for this action should be something like hiding behind a wall that’s getting shot to pieces while you try to figure out what to do next, having a quick tactical exchange with a fellow PC while under cover, or something else that would refresh your character.</p>
<h1>Ending Conflicts</h1>
<p>Battles end when one side (either PC or foe) is defeated, whether by death, retreat, binding, or some combination.</p>
<p>Half (rounded up) of every PC’s unused Charge dice remain while all unused Strike dice are turned into action dice (up to the Action Pool’s limit—any extra dice are discarded). The Action Pool remains at that level. Skill marks remain in place after a conflict. However, all of the conditions granted or inflicted by powers (like Poisoned and Shielded) are erased.</p>
<p>If you have Awesome Tokens left over at the end of a conflict, you can trade each one for one of the following benefits. Any unspent Awesome Tokens are lost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep all your Charge dice instead of half of them. You can feel ancestral power coursing through you.</li>
<li>Fill your Action Pool to the maximum. Your character skips off the smoldering battlefield where others limp and crawl from exhaustion.</li>
<li>Keep up to 3 of your Strike dice in your Strike Pool instead of converting them to Action dice. You remain ready, vigilant, and armed.</li>
<li>Replace one of your Skills and/or swap the ratings between them. These experiences have changed your focus and approach moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can spend your Awesome Tokens on other PCs too.</p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>Conflicts typically have goals that can be achieved aside from simply killing all those who stand before you. Goals are often open-ended, with multiple ways to achieve them. There can be just one or multiple goals, depending on the situation. It’s helpful to write each goal on its own index card, folded in half to form a tent.</p>
<p>Most of the time, once the goal is achieved by someone, its outcome cannot be altered anymore during the conflict. For example, if the PCs achieve a goal to free some prisoners, those prisoners cannot be caught again during this conflict. Exceptions to this rule need to be specifically noted. For more, see the section on chained goals below. In general, if a goal is not achieved, the status quo remains in place. If the goal was to rescue someone and no one achieved it, that person is still captive.</p>
<p>After the conflict, the GM rules whether unresolved goals can still be achieved or, if not, how they turned out. The only way for players to determine the outcome is to achieve the goal before defeating the adversity (or being defeated). When one side flees, however, the other side automatically wins all remaining goals.</p>
<p>Goals have a difficulty rating that indicates how hard it is to achieve the goal. A player who wants to determine the outcome of the goal has to roll as many successes with an Achievement as the difficulty rating.</p>
<p>An example of a goal would be:</p>
<p><strong>Secure the Matrea Crystal [5]</strong></p>
<p>This goal refers to an ancient crystal in the scene that the PCs and a foe are fighting over. It doesn’t matter which side currently has it. The goal has a difficulty rating of 5. Whoever first manages to score 5 or more successes with an Achievement will determine whether the crystal gets taken and by whom. The results of this Achievement will stand for the entire conflict.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which goals are created. The GM can establish them when setting up the conflict, or introduce them in the middle of a conflict. Players can suggest them during the conflict. Finally, some goals exist as default options - this is the case for binding, mastering, and controlling demons.</p>
<p>Most goals are open - any PC or foe can attempt to achieve or prevent it. Some goals are specific to a single side, or even to a single PC. In this case, only those specified can interact mechanically with the goal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, goals are parallel - either or both sides can achieve it. For example, a demon lumbers toward the keep of Duchess Lindee. Her guards see it, but start pulling the winch too late. The GM puts out the goal:</p>
<p><strong>Reach the Drawbridge Before It Closes [6]</strong></p>
<h1>Conditions and Effects</h1>
<p>Goals can impose mechanical conditions and effects on characters for the duration of the battle. If your foe in a conflict is exceedingly strong, you can have Goals that weaken them in actual game-mechanical terms: their Defense, powers, dice, turn options, and so forth.</p>
<p>For example, the PCs are fighting a giant tree demon with a Defense of 7. The GM introduces a Goal:</p>
<p><strong>Set Its Demon-Bark Ablaze [6]</strong> - Reduce Defense by 2.</p>
<p>If the PCs are fighting a band of brigands on a rooftop during a storm, a player might ask, “Can I hold my sword skyward, chanting to the gods of storm, and use my Hymns Skill to channel their lightning energies?” This is a great opportunity for the GM to create a new Goal:</p>
<p><strong>Channel the Lightning Gods [5]</strong> - Your next Strike gains +2 bonus dice, and if it inflicts a Wound, the target is stunned for one round. Achieving this Goal deals you one Wound.</p>
<h1>Controlling Demons</h1>
<p>Demons can be bound within shards of crystal, summoned onto the battlefield when needed, and forced to obey your commands.These are are Goals that can be attempted via Achievements.</p>
<p>The difficulty to bind and imprison a demon is equal to its <em>current Defense + remaining Wounds + Hubris.</em> Once bound, a demon is contained within a small crystal shard and is relatively safe to transport.</p>
<p>Demons can summoned from their crystal prisons. The difficulty to do this is equal to its full Defense. It returns to the battlefield with full Defense, the same amount of remaining Wounds it had when bound, and no Hubris.</p>
<p>Bound demons can be commanded on the battlefield. Each demon can be commanded once per round (set of PC turns and foe turns). The difficulty of commanding a bound demon is its current Hubris. If you succeed, you get to take one turn as the demon. Afterward, its Hubris goes up by 2. If you fail a roll to command a demon, it cannot be commanded again this battle. If it had full Hubris, the GM regains control of it and the binding is broken.</p>
<p>If a bound demon on the battlefield is not commanded during a round, it makes a Maneuver using its best Skill.</p>
<p>Each time a bound demon takes a Wound, its Hubris goes up by 1.</p>
<h1>GMing Rookvale</h1>
<p>As the GM of Rookvale, there are a couple principles to keep at the forefront of your mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make Rookvale worth saving</li>
<li>Make saving Rookvale difficult</li>
<li>Be a fan of the PCs</li>
<li>Make each battle distinct and difficult</li>
</ul>
<p>Your jobs include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leap forward with details about Rookvale</li>
<li>Ask the right questions, revealing who these PCs are and what they care about</li>
<li>Present Setup Scenes that highlight new facets of these characters and their shared approach</li>
<li>Choose which demons and other foes will be present during each battle</li>
<li>Choose which goals will be present during each battle, both beforehand and spontaneously as the situation evolves in unforseen directions</li>
<li>Be responsive to and collaborative with your players</li>
<li>Play your demons without pulling any punches</li>
<li>Be willing to rend PCs limb from limb if the dice go that way</li>
<li>Watch social cues and help facilitate a fun game</li>
<li>Make wails of mock indignation when your demons are trapped in crystal prisons, but secretly love it</li>
<li>Between battles, update the Map of the Scourge and take your map-related actions (see page 15)</li>
<li>Pay attention to every character scene</li>
</ul>
<h1>Foes Deconstructed</h1>
<p><strong>Rank / Type:</strong> The demon’s rank (Lesser Demon, Greater Demon, etc) and whether it is a solo, squad, or swarm.</p>
<p><strong>Action (AP):</strong> How many Action dice the foe starts wtih, and also their Action Pool maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Strike (SP):</strong> How many Strike dice the foe starts with. (Strike Pools have no maximum.) This section may also show 1-2 arrow symbols. These indicate bonus dice that the foe rolls during every Strike.</p>
<p><strong>Charge Pool (CP):</strong> The first number is how many Charge dice the foe start with, and the second is their Charge Pool maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> This is the number of basic dice the adversity gets for a Maneuver. Unlike PCs, many foes only have a single Skill. Foes with 1 Skill do not mark their Skill to earn bonus dice, but foes with two or more Skills do.</p>
<p><strong>Defense:</strong> This specifies how hard it is to wound the foe.</p>
<p><strong>Hubris:</strong> A factor in binding and commanding demons.</p>
<p><strong>Wound Circles:</strong> How many Wounds it takes to defeat the foe. In the case of squads and swarms, each Wound might represent an entire character killed.</p>
<p><strong>Powers:</strong> Foes tend to have a smattering of passive and Charge powers. Some also have weaknesses.</p>
<h1>Map of the Scourge</h1>
<p>As GM, you’ll need the Map of the Scourge, located on page 17. Before the first session begins, pick 3-5 Lesser Demons and pencil each one under a duchy name.</p>
<p>Between battles, choose 1 or 2 of the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new demon to the map, of a rank that already exists on the map</li>
<li>Move any number of demons around on the map</li>
<li>Narrate a scene about how a demon causes irrevocable harm to the duchy it is currently in</li>
<li>Make a Demon Evolution roll (see page 16)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the PCs win a battle against a demon, erase its name from the map - unless it’s been established that there are more of it lurking about the duchy.</p>
<p>If the map is running out of demons, and the game begs to continue longer, you can add this option to the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add three Lesser Demons or two Greater Demons to the map, scattered across multiple duchies</li>
</ul>
<p>After all the Character Scenes and right before the Setup Scene, ask the players which threat they attempt to track down next, and which duchies they need to pass through to get there. You can choose to have them encounter their sought threat, or any other threat present in the duchies they move through and into. See page 14 for guidelines on how to make these choices and keep battles distinct. The Setup Scene you frame should reflect your choices.</p>
<h1>Battles Are Scenarios</h1>
<p>Each battle is a new scenario. One of your guiding principles as GM is to make sure that each battle is distinct and difficult.</p>
<p>Consider ways to heighten the danger associated with a certain demon. Do they have cultist attendants encircling them? Are they on the verge of evolution? Are there more of them than you’d previously thought? Are they guarding a clutch of volatile demon eggs? Consider ways to add an extra dimension to the battle. Are there hostages that must be rescued? Is the fight taking place on a precarious cliff?</p>
<p>You can always add additional barriers and objectives to a battle. You can add Humans, Lesser Demons, and Demon Support to a battle if doing so will help ensure that the fight is distinct and difficult. You can even add bigger surprise opponents to a battle if truly needed.</p>
<p>Each duchy has its own page, adding some special rules for the battles that transpire within that duchy, and suggesting to the GM some options for keeping battles in that region distinct.</p>
<h1>Demon Evolution</h1>
<p>At the start of the game, there will only be Lesser Demons on the map. In order to introduce even bigger demons into the game, you’ll need to evolve the ones already in play.</p>
<p>Each demon card lists its evolutionary path. For example, Shadowblade evolves into Shadowbane, which in turn can evolve into the Shadow Lord.</p>
<p>Demons can involve between battles or right in the middle of them.</p>
<p>Whenever you make a Demon Evolution roll between battles, roll a six-sided die. If your score is greater than the next evolutionary form’s Hubris score, the demon evolves! Foreshadow or describe that in some way!</p>
<p>If you make a Demon Evolution roll and don’t succeed, record your score next to the demon’s name on the map. Add that number as a bonus to your next Demon Evolution roll with this particular demon. Each time you fail to evolve your demon, its potential to evolve grows stronger and more imminent.</p>
<p>During a battle, each demon has a closed Goal to evolve, with a difficulty of twice their Hubris, minus any outstanding bonuses from failed Demon Evolution rolls.</p>
<h1>Rank and Might</h1>
<p>Demons have ranks. Most belong to the same four categories: Lesser Demon, Greater Demon, Demon Lieutenant, Demon Lord. Others have unique ranks.</p>
<p>Through demon evolution, you’ll gain access to higher ranks of demons. Once you’ve got a Greater Demon in play, it’s easy to bring more in - it just takes an action on the Map of the Scourge.</p>
<p>You’ll note that demons of unique rank can’t be used to bring other types of demon onto the Map of the Scourge. For example, a Hunter Demon can’t welcome a Greater Demon onto the map.</p>
<p>When demons cause irrevocable harm in a duchy (as per the Map of the Scourge option), the scale and impact should be judged based on their rank, and also their particular nature. A Lesser Demon might raze a church, but a Greater Demon could bring rot and pestilence to an entire valley.</p>
<h1>Map of the Scourge</h1>
<p>Canter is the smallest region, and in the centre of the map. It touches three other regions: to its north-west is Lian, to its north-east is Naletta and to its south is Tabis. Dushik is between Lian and Naletta. Brosk is between Tabis and Naletta. Kinis is between Tabis and Lian. </p>
<h1>Naletta</h1>
<p>Naletta lies to the north-east, a land dominated by misty hills and sharp valleys. It is the home of Rookvale’s largest crystal deposits, and as such attracts a great many of the realm’s mystics and alchemists. Since the demons emerged, crystal has been in high demand, and Duchess Null has mechanized the extraction process to meet demand. Those tied to the crystals and the hills have responded with anger and anguish, threatening revolt if these destructive practices continue.</p>
<p>When in Naletta, PCs have access to this once-per-battle Goal:</p>
<p><strong>Thrumming Hills [6]</strong></p>
<p>You awaken the crystal shards embedded in the earth all around you. All demons immediately lose 1 Hubris.</p>
<h2>A Potential Naletta Battle</h2>
<p>A militant faction in Naletta has had enough of this destructive industry! They bate one of the demons into attacking a Crystal Harvesting Tower. The PCs arrive with the militants still present and the tower under attack (Goals can be associated with each).</p>
<h1>Dushik</h1>
<p>Dushik lies to the far north of Rookvale, characterized by a mixture of scraggly sub-alpine forests and expanses of silty plateau. The demon incursion gained a foothold in Dushik early and easily, due to its small population and lack of any official military or guard presence.</p>
<p>Demon hive have emerged throughout the duchy - strange towers of black metal that reek of oil and sulfur. Dushik is occupied territory, and many suggest that it’s no longer worth trying to save. Others cry out that Dushik is their home, or the home of their loved ones.</p>
<p>When in Dushik, PCs and their foes all start each battle with the <em>Shivering</em> condition. While affected by this condition, characters (even demons) each lose 1 die from their Action Pool at the start of each turn.</p>
<h2>A Potential Dushik Battle</h2>
<p>Mewling servitor demons are scrambling to finish a new hive tower. Two Greater Demons stand guard to ensure its successful construction. Unless the PCs</p>
<p>complete the goal Halt Tower Construction [8] within 5 turns, it goes live and a new demon is summoned!</p>
<h1>Tabis</h1>
<p>Tabis is a place of steep mountain ranges and crooked valleys. Villages are everywhere in Tabis, though rarely does one encounter one of more than a few hundred people. The demons have only just reached Tabis.</p>
<p>Tabians are generally wary of outsiders. Tinders often disguise themselves when moving through Tabis, as the region is notorious for its contempt toward anyone visibly tinder. But those who gain the acceptance of a Tabian community tend to be invited in with open arms and treated as inalienable family.</p>
<p>When in Tabis, PCs have access to this power:</p>
<p><strong>➹ Hiding Hole</strong></p>
<p><em>Type: Maneuver / Cost: 2 Charge</em></p>
<p>Complete your Maneuver. End it in a rocky hiding place. You gain +1 Defense until the start of your next turn.</p>
<h2>A Potential Tabis Battle</h2>
<p>A small village has been harbouring a tied-up demon, attempting to train it to defend their hillside. It got loose! But still some of the villagers will refuse to let you face it, and some may even fight to keep it safe.</p>
<h1>Canter</h1>
<p>Canter is the smallest duchy, and the most densely populated. It is dominated by a city of steel and cathedrals, whose machine-towers were heralded as the most technologically-advanced marvel in all of Rookvale, prior to the emergence of the smog-belching demon hives in the northern duchies.</p>
<p>The demon incursion has left Canter in uproar. Its various cults have become militant, taking to the streets to cast blame on different potential causes: their depen-dence on machines, the sins of other duchies, and so on.</p>
<p>When in Canter, PCs have access to this power:</p>
<p><strong>➹ Steam Funnel</strong></p>
<p><em>Type: Strike / Cost: 2 Charge</em></p>
<p>Add +2 bonus dice to a Strike against a swarm or +1 bonus die to a Strike against a squad.</p>
<h2>A Potential Canter Battle</h2>
<p>The PCs encounter two demons on a rooftop. Both have a Charge power that allows them to move to another rooftop. The PCs need to keep up with them (Achieve-ments for rooftop leaping?) or trap them somehow.</p>
<h1>Kinis</h1>
<p>Kinis is Rookvale’s only seaside duchy. While the Grand Duchess may have succeeded in forging alliances with her neighbors on land, the sea brings many enemies to the ports of Kinis. The Kinian military is larger than that of all the other duchies combined. It is the only duchy that had truly been through war or battle in decades, prior to the arrival of the demons.</p>
<p>There is rumour of seaside communes that worship the demons, and of strange rituals and dances that intend to summon yet more terrors from the ocean depths.</p>
<p>While in Kinis, the PCs gain access to this power:</p>
<p><strong>➹ A Salty Breeze</strong></p>
<p><em>Type: Action / Cost: 2 Charge</em></p>
<p>You Catch Your Breath, and also remove one condition.</p>
<h2>A Potential Kinis Battle</h2>
<p>Pirates have managed to make it over the outer walls of a Kinian fort. Two squads are now attempting to raid the fort’s homes and supplies. The ensuing battle awakens and draws forth a kraken-esque Demon Lieutenant that had previously slumbered off the coast.</p>
<h1>Brosk</h1>
<p>Brosk is Rookvale’s second-largest source of crystal deposits, after Naletta. It has very few permanent residents, as its silty flats flood every warm season.</p>
<p>Some of the seasonal dig teams swear that the crystals are alive in Brosk, that they talk to one another, and that the richer deposits are capable of mobilizing their rock casings and congregating together in thrumming ritual.</p>
<p>Bandits and outlaws will sometimes flee to the flats of Brosk, to hide out amidst its lonely pillars.</p>
<p>While in Brosk, the PCs gain access to this power:</p>
<p><strong>➹ Jagged Rocks</strong></p>
<p><em>Type: Strike / Cost: 2 Charge</em></p>
<p>Add +2 bonus dice to a Strike against a solo or +1 bonus die to a Strike against a squad.</p>
<h2>A Potential Brosk Battle</h2>
<p>The battlefield begins to rapidly flood. After the second turn, give everyone the Flooded condition (3s no longer count as successes during your rolls), and introduce a Goal like Get To Higher Ground [4] to get rid of it.</p>
<h1>Lian</h1>
<p>Lian is the only duchy that remains intact out of Rookvale’s founding four. It is widely recognized as the birthplace of both jack and tinder, and pride and status tend to surround those identities within the duchy.</p>
<p>Lian is the home of many artists, especially weavers and sculptors. When demons first set foot in the duchy, its scientists and humanitarian scholars chose to set a course of radical empathy: learning about the demons, setting up sanctuary spaces, and attempting to pacify them. It ended with many dead. Now Lian fights as one.</p>
<p>While in Lian, the PCs gain access to this power:</p>
<p><strong>➹ Fight As One</strong></p>
<p><em>Type: Action (Linked Strike) / Cost: 3 Charge</em></p>
<p>Gather your dice as if for a Strike. Roll them. Set aside 5-6s, return 3-4s to your Strike Pool, and discard 1-2s. Another PC (or a bound demon) can make a Strike this round and add your set-aside dice as bonus dice.</p>
<h2>A Potential Lian Battle</h2>
<p>A squad of Lian footsoldiers join you in battle, fighting on your side against demons. Can you keep them safe?</p>
