A public copyright licence (or public licence) is a licence by which a licensor can grant additional copyright permissions to licensees and in which the licensees are unlimited. In other words, when a public copyright licence is applied to a work, it can be used by any person according to the conditions of the licence. 

The *New York Times* also described these as open copyright licences, although this causes confusion with free, libre and open licences, which are a subcategory of public copyright licences. 

An example of a non‒public copyright licence is the (now deprecated) Creative Commons Developing Nations License, which only lessened restrictions on people living in certain countries (not unlimited licensees).
## Narrower definition
The Open Knowledge Foundation has used a narrower definition of a public copyright licence, which is that the *licensors* as well as the licensees are unlimited. In other words, any person could apply the public copyright licence to their works. Compare to the UK Open Government License, which would need to be re-written to be used by anyone other than the government of the United Kingdom. This wiki uses the broader definition.

The Open Definition describes copyright licences where the licensors are limited as “non-reusable licences”: http://opendefinition.org/licenses/
