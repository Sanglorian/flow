I'd like to focus on articles and chapters of books rather than whole books or websites for the reader. Ideally, each piece of reading material will serve a discrete purpose, rather than just provide background information or a broad picture. There are already pages for [IP Minimalism](/ip-minimalism/) and [FLO community](/flo-community/) for whole books and websites related to these issues.
