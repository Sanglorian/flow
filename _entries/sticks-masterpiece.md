    "Cute, little Stick learns that while she may not know how to paint a masterpiece, she can do small and simple things. These small and simple things, composed over a lifetime, are what become her masterpiece. And the result is more beautiful than she could have imagined.

    Sometimes challenges can make us feel scared. When we doubt ourselves, we often become too afraid to try. The secret, though, is to remember that all great things happen one small step at a time."
