    Meet Ejoq Dosantos: loner, nomad, and professional gunner for corporate and privately-owned armed merchant vessels.
    In a future filled with pirates, venal business interests, and interstellar intrigue, the fates of people, ships, and entire worlds can sometimes be in just one man's hands.
    Star-spanning super-nations, high technology, and good old-fashioned greed!
    Better take a deep breath!
