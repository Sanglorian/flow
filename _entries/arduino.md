  main_description: |-
    Arduino is both hardware and open-source software giving the opportunity to discover, use and interact with the analogical and numeric world at relatively low cost.
    
    The Arduino open-source library (often mistakenly named O/S) gives a level of abstraction which make learning and development easier and faster.
    
    Company like microchip are selling clone of the arduino platform named [ChipKit](http://chipkit.net/) based on their pic32 MIPS core.
