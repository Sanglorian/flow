    The University of Texas at Austin's Insect Image Lab will create thousands of beautiful, unique, and informative visual works for release into the public domain. Under the mentorship of Dr. Alex Wild, professional photographer and UT's curator of entomology, a team of students will learn the art and artistry of digital microphotography while capturing images of Texas's smallest wildlife. The resulting image collection will be open for anyone to use, free of the constraints of traditional copyright.
