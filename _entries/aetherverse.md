  short_description: "Aetherverse is a tabletop sci-fi wargame that I first published in 2004. The concept of the game was to create a sort of “universal” rules system that players could use to create and play with armies sourced from any of the many miniatures manufacturers on the market. While this had been done before in a generic sense, I designed the system to build armies that had real character rather than just being a collection of numbers."
