  short_description: "Hexoshi is a libre game generally inspired by the Metroid series. It is a work in progress, but once completed, it will be my biggest game yet, with a maze-like world spanning hundreds of individual rooms. I intend to make this one of the greatest libre free-roaming games to date."
