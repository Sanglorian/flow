**Free, libre and open licences**, **free and open licences** or **FLO licences** are copyright licences that have only free and open terms.

Four different bodies maintain lists of approved FLO licences: the Open Source Initiative, the Free Software Foundation, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Free Culture Foundation. There are subtle differences in how these bodies determine whether a work is free/libre/open, but essentially agreement on whether a licence is free/libre/open.

Licences on this wiki that are approved by one of the four bodies are:

## For culture and content

## For software and source code
