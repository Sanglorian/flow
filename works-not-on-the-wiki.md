This page is for listing works that are eligible to be added to the wiki, but haven't been yet. 
* Wreck Age, CC BY-NC-SA
* [Species & Societies](http://www.wargamevault.com/product/134356/Species--Societies), CC BY-SA

## All Media
* **[CC Wiki](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Main_Page):** Creative Commons' wiki has case studies and content directories for Creative Commons-licensed works in particular. There are 404 case studies (as of October 2014) and many entries in the content directories, but it is not regularly updated, the metadata for most projects and organisations is fairly limited and it focuses on Creative Commons licences rather than free and open licences specifically.

## Specific Media
* **[Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts):** A collection of web-enabled free and open fonts.
* **Free and Open Source Software:** There are many directories of free and open source software, including [FOSS](http://freeopensourcesoftware.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), the [Catalog of Free and Open Source Software for Education](http://www.osv.org.au/index.cgi?tid=155), the [Free Software Directory](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page), and [many more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_software_project_directories). In fact, this space is so well provided for (and there is so much free and open source software out there) that it's the general policy of this wiki not to record free and open source software. Always do add it if you want to, but it is not a priority.
