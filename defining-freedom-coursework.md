## Course
The Defining Freedom 'course' is a set of webpages designed to teach you what libre and shareable resources are, why they matter and how you can use them to your advantage. 

## Defining the movements
Just as 'death duties' and 'estate taxes' refer to the same concept but are used by different groups of people, so too do synonyms of 'libre' have particular connotations. 

Typically, the words 'free' and 'freedom' are associated with the Free Software Foundation, which argues that traditional copyright tramples on the rights of consumers. In their eyes, free software is a moral necessity.

By contrast, the words 'open' and 'openness' are associated with the Open Source Initiative, which argues that open source is a more efficient and cost-effective model for software creation. In their eyes, open source is a pragmatic alternative to traditional copyright.

## Defining the terms

| Type | Freedom | Openness | Libre-ness | Compromise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Software | Free software | Open source | Software libre | F/OSS or FLOSS |
| Content | Free cultural work, free content | Open content, open knowledge | Libre content | N/A |


**FLOSS:** Free, libre and open source software.

**F/OSS:** Free/open source software.

**Libre:** A libre work is one where copies (both duplicates and derivatives) can be made of the work without the copyright holder's permission. Some conditions can be imposed on making of the copies, but these conditions cannot limit the content of the copy or the way in which it is distributed.

**Shareable Resource:** Shareable resources are works under Creative Commons licences or, more broadly, all libre and proprietary content. 

## Freedom
**FSF-approved licence:** The Free Software Foundation approves licences which are compatible with the four software freedoms, even if those licences are not intended for use with software. Most FSF-approved licences are libre licences. (<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html>)

**Free software licence:** All free software licences are libre, but not all libre licences are free software licences (a licence must be designed specifically for software to qualify). (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses>)

**Free software:** Free software is a synonym of libre software.

Do not confuse free software (which is free-as-in-speech) with gratis software or freeware (which are free-as-in-beer) nor with shareware (which grants some freedoms, but not the right to modify or sell the work). 

**Free culture licence:** A free culture licence is a libre licence. (<http://freedomdefined.org/Definition>)

**Free culture work:** Free cultural works must be under a libre licence, but also meet four further definitions which ensure that no one's access to the work is limited. (<http://freedomdefined.org/Definition>)

**Free content/information:** A synonym of free cultural work. (<http://wikieducator.org/Wikieducator_tutorial/What_is_free_content/Free_content_defined>)

## Openness
**OSI-approved licence:** The Open Source Initiative approves licences which are compatible with the Open Source Definition. So far, all such licences seem to be designed for software. (<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>)

**Open source licence:** All open source licences are libre, but not all libre licences are open source licences (a licence must be designed specifically for software to qualify).

**Open source:** Open source software is a synonym of libre software. However, open source can also be used to describe non-software libre as well. For example, [Creative Commons Attribution](/license/creative-commons-attribution/) qualifies as an open source licence though it is not recommended for software licensing. 

Do not confuse open source (which is not prescriptive) with open-by-rule or the four opens (which are prescriptive) nor with opposition to open core and exclusive content (which are compatible with open source). Open source has a complicated relationship with 'open content', 'open culture', 'open knowledge', 'open education', 'open data', 'open access' and 'open gaming'. (<http://opensource.org/docs/osd>)

**Open service/open software service:** Online software services are considered open services if the data of the service is open knowledge (except for personal data which must be available to the relevant individual), the source code is libre and the source code is available to those who use the service. 

**Open knowledge:** Open knowledge is a synonym of libre knowledge. It includes libre content, data and information. (<http://www.opendefinition.org/okd/>)

**Open content:** There is disagreement about whether open content is a synonym of libre content (as Open Definition alleges) or whether semi-libre and pseudo-libre (or semi-libre but not pseudo-libre) content qualifies as well as described in the [Open Source Media Definition](http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Media_Definition).

**Open data:** Open data has not been strictly defined. Libre data certainly qualifies, but so too may semi-libre and pseudo-libre data. Open data is more of a statement of principles or best practice rather than a clear label that can be applied to a piece of research. 

**Open access:** Open access describes works which can be accessed online without restriction. A libre work which is not readily accessible qualifies (at least until someone makes it accessible) while a non-libre work which is gratis and publicly-available would. 

**Open publishing:** Open publishing describes a transparent process of creating content, where editorial decisions are visible for all and anyone can submit content for consideration. The copyright status of those works, however, could be libre or proprietary. 

**Open-by-rule:** Open-by-rule describes a software development process which is meritocratic, oligarchic and transparent. (<http://webmink.com/essays/open-by-rule/>)

## Beyond 'all rights reserved'
All works of creative expression – books, songs, blog posts, speeches and so on – are under copyright by default. This means that, unless otherwise mentioned, all rights to make copies of that work are reserved by the author. 

The law makes some exceptions to copyright, mainly for parodies, news reports and ‘fair dealing’. In addition, some works are in the public domain – typically because it’s been many years since their creator died. Public domain works are not under copyright, so they can be copied by anyone for any purpose.

Some people want others to copy their works. They can do this through exclusive contracts, giving permission to particular people (perhaps publishers, music companies or friends) to make copies. They can also give permission when people ask for it: “Sure you can use my photo – thanks for asking!”

However, some people want to give broader permission than that, for a number of reasons. Maybe they’re sick of expressly giving permission to everyone. Maybe they know that many people would like to use their work but never bother to ask. Maybe they want to grant permission even after they die. 

Shareable resources licences are a way of avoiding these problems. By releasing a work under a shareable resource licence, the creator gives everyone permission to copy the work under some circumstances. As long as they follow those conditions, they don’t need to pay royalties and they don’t violate copyright law.

But what conditions are imposed? That depends on the particular shareable resource licence chosen.

## Shareable resources
If a work can be copied verbatim by any person for any non-commercial purpose, it is a shareable resource. In addition, works that can be adapted (copied non-verbatim) and works that can be copied for any purpose (including commercial purposes) also count as shareable resources.

Works that can be copied (verbatim or adapted) for any purpose (including commercial ones) are shareable resources, but they also belong to a sub-category: libre works. These are described in greater detail later.

Those works which are shareable resources but not libre are described as ‘proprietary’ works. Their copyright holder still has exclusive rights to them (either the right to adapt or the right to copy commercially, or both) and therefore they cannot be described as ‘libre’. In addition, all works which are not shareable resources are also proprietary.

A work can become shareable resources in one of two ways. Either it can fall into the public domain by law (usually because it’s been many years since the death of the author) or its copyright holder can release it under a shareable resource licence. The most famous shareable resource licences are the Creative Commons licences, but there are many others.

## FLOCC, FLOSS and libre
A libre work is one which can be copied (in its original or modified form) by any person for any purpose. There are usually some conditions placed on that copying, but they never fetter in what way you can copy it or how you share it. 

There are a number of synonyms for libre. In the software community, there’s ‘free software’, ‘software libre’ and ‘open source’ software. ‘F/OCC’ (‘free/open source software’) and ‘FLOSS’ (‘free, libre and open source software’) are compromises between these terms.

In the cultural community, the terms ‘free cultural work’ and ‘open content’ are used. There’s also the compromise term ‘FLOCC’ or ‘free, libre and open cultural content’.

The reason for these different terms is that there are different ideological movements in the libre community. Some emphasise freedom and rights (the free software and free culture movements) and others emphasise pragmatism and business (the open source and open content movements). They use different terms for libre because they want to emphasise different qualities of libre works.

### It’s not about money
The terms ‘free software’ and ‘free cultural works’ might make you think that these works are free of charge. That’s not necessarily true. People sometimes pay a lot of money for free software and free cultural works. ‘Free’ refers to freedoms, not price.

For example, a hard copy version of Shakespeare’s plays is ‘free’ in that you can use it for any purpose, but you can’t walk out of a bookshop with it unless you pay for it first. Once you’ve bought it, you can make copies of it, perform the plays, adapt them to make your own plays and so on. You’re free to use them, but they’re not free of charge.

### What are acceptable conditions?
According to the [Definition of Free Cultural Works](/definition-of-free-cultural-works/), there are three restrictions that can be placed on a libre licence without it becoming proprietary.

#### Attribution of authors and no endorsement
A libre licence can require that the original work and its creator are recognised in some way, and also that it be made clear that the author does not endorse the adaptation. Use of trademarks may also be limited by the licence.

#### Transmission of freedoms
Libre licences sometimes require that all derivative works are themselves licensed under the same licence as the original work. Otherwise, someone could adapt a libre work but not make that adaptation available for others to share and adapt.

Other terms for this condition include ‘reciprocal’, ‘share alike’, ‘viral’ or ‘copyleft’. The first three terms can describe proprietary works where adaptations must be kept under the same (proprietary) licence. The final term, ‘copyleft’, can only describe libre works.

There are two forms of copyleft. Strong copyleft works can only be distributed with other libre works. Weak copyleft works can be distributed with proprietary works, as long as the work itself is still copyleft.

A licence without a reciprocal condition is called a ‘permissive’ or ‘copyfree’ licence.

#### Protection of freedoms
These are a set of conditions which require the work to be friendly to the end user. For example, there’s not much use giving me the legal right to edit a program if the program cannot be edited. 

As with the other conditions listed above, these are only present in some libre licences.

* **Availability of source data:** The information and files behind a work must also be made available. For example, the code of a program or the 3D models used in a movie must be made available as well. 
* **Use of a free format:** The work is available in (and perhaps only available in) a file format that is not protected by intellectual property law. Otherwise, a work could be made impossible to open if the owners of that format banned its use in software.
* **No technical restrictions:** The work cannot have its freedoms locked away by technology like DRM (Digital Rights Management, which stops files from being opened and copied in certain ways). 
* **No other restrictions or limitations:** Other legal restrictions like contracts, patents and so on, cannot be imposed on the work. 

#### Categories of libre
There are three categories of libre. 
* **Public domain:** Public domain works are not under copyright and there are no restrictions relating to their copying. (Moral rights, trademarks and other non-copyright laws may still apply).
* **Permissive or copycentre libre:** Adaptations and derivatives of works under permissive libre licences do not need to be libre themselves. Arguably, public domain works are a sub-category of permissive libre works.
* **Reciprocal or copyleft libre:** Adaptations and derivatives of works under reciprocal libre licences must themselves be libre (described above under ‘What are acceptable conditions?’).
